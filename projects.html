	<p>I am always working on something, whether it's a web-application
        architecture, a visualization, or just some algorithmic puzzle. I like to know how
        things work, so I will crack open my
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw">GitHub account</a>, create a
        repository, and do something. Typically it will be an iOS app, a JavaScript
        exploration, or a Java web-app for Tomcat. AWS is my current go-to for deploying
        static websites and applications of various sorts. Here's a few things I've
        dabbled on you can take a look at:</p>

                My background is in computer graphics. It's my first love, and I can trace
                that all the way back to when I first started programming little games on
                the Atari 400 computer my Dad would bring home from work on the weekends
                (pre-1980). I periodically like to revisit the topic to keep up with
                modern trends.

                OpenGL hasn't been my native tongue since leaving SGI in the late 1990s,
                but it's become the standard for 3D on the web. I looked at a few of the
                well-known packages, like three.js, and decided I was more interested in
                learning the lower-level API and developing my own "middleware" with a
                bias towards the types of things I want to draw.

                Thus, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/webgl.js">WebGL.js</a> was born,
                a very simple rendering interface. I expect that I will keep coming back
                to this over many years.

                While working in the aerospace industry on Space Situational Awareness
                (SSA) topics, I realized I needed a better understanding of concepts that
                were everyday to the aerospace engineers. Being a visual guy, I figured
                I'd make it a visual exploration.
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/astro.js">Astro.js</a> is the
                manifestation of that.
            </p>
            <p>
                I found it rather challenging to validate my results, so I turned to other
                sources, including satellite and other imagery from various space missions
                to compare my images with "real" results. I learned a lot, and want to
                continue exploring this domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Along the way, one of the biggest challenges was the size of the starfield
                texture. In order to be good quality, I was using a PNG file that was over
                40Mb. I could have used one of the typical texture compression formats to
                try to get that smaller, but instead I hunted down the
                <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/YaleBrightStarCatalog">Yale Bright
                Star Catalog</a> and converted it to JSON. I used the star temperature
                information, or the classification if temperature wasn't available, to set
                the color. This file is MUCH smaller, and I generate geometry for the
                stars rendered at screen resolution...

            <p>
                One thing that I became particular fascinated with was some of the eclipse
                imagery from the EPIC/DISCOVR mission. Shadows are a particular challenge
                in Z-buffered rendering (like OpenGL), but in this case with only one
                occluder, I thought it would be pretty straight-forward. I had some ideas
                about the math for computing umbra and penumbra analytically, which I
                explored in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/circle-area">a
                circle/circle intersection visualization</a>. I determined a much simpler
                approximation that was a pretty good fit, which is what I use in the
                Earth shader. I used the same computations on the Moon shader, so you can
                explore both solar and lunar eclipses.
