    <p>I am always working on something, whether it's a web-application
        architecture, a visualization, or just some algorithmic puzzle. I like to know how
        things work, so I will crack open my
        <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw">GitHub account</a>, create a
        repository, and do something. Typically it will be an iOS app, a JavaScript
        exploration, or a Java web-app for Tomcat. AWS is my current go-to for deploying
        static websites and applications of various sorts. Here's a few things I've
        dabbled on you can take a look at:</p>

    <h2>WebGL</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            My background is in computer graphics. It's my first love, and I can trace
            that all the way back to when I first started programming little games on
            the Atari 400 computer my Dad would bring home from work on the weekends
            (pre-1980). I periodically like to revisit the topic to keep up with
            modern trends.
        </p>
        <p>
            OpenGL hasn't been my native tongue since leaving SGI in the late 1990s,
            but it's become the standard for 3D on the web. I looked at a few of the
            well-known packages, like three.js, and decided I was more interested in
            learning the lower-level API and developing my own "middleware" with a
            bias towards the types of things I want to draw.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus,
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/webgl.js">WebGL.js</a> was born,
            a very simple rendering interface. I expect that I will keep coming back
            to this over many years.
        </p>

    <h2>Astro</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            While working in the aerospace industry on Space Situational Awareness
            (SSA) topics, I realized I needed a better understanding of concepts that
            were everyday to the aerospace engineers. Being a visual guy, I figured
            I'd make it a visual exploration.
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/astro.js">Astro.js</a> is the
            manifestation of that, built using the aforementioned WebGL.js library.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="projects/astro.png" class="inline-img"></img>
        </div>
        <p>
            The model includes <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System">WGS-84</a> planetary
            geometry with "real" day and night textures assembled from NASA's Blue Marble
            project, cloud textures based on GEOS satellite infrared imagery, and
            physically based approximations of the atmospheric affect on the appearance of
            the Earth to an outside observer. I added a variety of cameras to the scene to
            look at the Earth-Moon-Sol system in a variety of new ways.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found it rather challenging to validate my results, so I turned to other
            sources, including satellite and other imagery from various space missions
            to compare my images with "real" results. I learned a lot, and want to
            continue exploring this domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another challenge I encountered was the size of the starfield
            texture I was using. In order to be good quality, I was using a PNG file that was over
            40Mb. I could have used one of the typical texture compression formats to
            try to get that smaller, but instead I hunted down the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/YaleBrightStarCatalog">Yale Bright
                Star Catalog</a> and converted it to JSON. I used the star temperature
            information, or the classification if temperature wasn't available, to set
            the color. This file is MUCH smaller, and I generate geometry for the
            stars rendered at screen resolution. Note that it does not include Nebula or other
            Messier objects, of which a few are significant members of prominent constellations.

        </div>
        <p>
            I became fascinated with some of the eclipse
            imagery from the
            <a target="_blank" href="https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/">EPIC/DISCOVR</a>
            mission. Shadows are a challenge
            in Z-buffered rendering (like OpenGL), but in this case with only one
            occluder, I thought it would be pretty straight-forward. I had some ideas
            about the math for computing umbra and penumbra analytically, which I
            explored in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/brettonw/circle-area">a
            circle/circle intersection visualization</a>.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="projects/circle-circle.png" class="inline-img"></img>
        </div>
        <p>
            Using the circle intersection visualization, I determined a much simpler
            approximation that was a pretty good fit, which is what I use in the Earth
            shader. I used the same computations on the Moon shader, so you can explore
            both solar and lunar eclipses.

    <h2>Epidimiology</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>I fancy myself an amateur epidimiologist. I studied the topic enough to be able
            to talk about disease spread intelligently, because I found myself wondering
            about potential contagions like Ebola, while close friends were dealing with
            issues around HPV and cervical cancer. One of my conclusions is that the
            population-level study of disease has been a great boon to goverment handling
            of potential epidemics, but it completely forgets the human element of health.
        </p>
        <p>
            My thesis is that by empowering individuals to make smarter choices, we can
            reduce or eliminate the spread of certain pathogens that are otherwise
            considered "contained" by the population-level study. For many of people who
            suffer from these diseases, they are life changing.
        </p>
        <p>
            My <a target="_blank" href="http://disease-transmission.azurewebsites.net/">Disease
            Transmission Simulator</a> was born out of a desire to visualize the details
            of transmission at an individual level using stochastic techniques to
            approximate the behavior of small groups as proxies for individuals. This
            simulation is validated by the fact that it exhibits many of the classic
            population-level phenomena.
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="projects/transmission.png" class="inline-img"></img>
        </div>
        <p>
            The simulation is built in pure Javascript using charting tools and
            tree-visualization tools available on GitHub (which I also wrote).

    <h2>Bedrock</h2>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            For many years I've been using a bit of code I developed to quickly prototype
            micro-services written in Java on a Tomcat platform...
